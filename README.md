# <span style="font-size:larger;">Backend Configuration</span>

After following the steps in the project's main directory, navigate to the backend folder with the following command:

`cd backend`

Once inside, install all dependencies with the command:

`npm i`

After installing the necessary files, let's configure the DATABASE. Create a `.env` file within the backend folder based on the `.env.example` file and insert your PostgreSQL connection credentials. It should look like this:

After configuring the environment variables, run the `npx prisma migrate dev` command to perform migrations on the database. You should receive a message like this:

![image](https://github.com/Xugnon/tatto_studio/assets/85856491/c3ecb975-fe33-4ee4-ac3b-836aaf6c972f)

After running the migrations, execute the `npx prisma generate` command to update the Prisma Client:

<h2>Running Backend</h2>

The backend is running on port 3333, so make sure you don't have another application running on the same port. Now that you have the environment configured, run it with the command:

`npm run dev`

You should see the following message:

# <span style="font-size:larger;">Tests</span>

The tests are divided into two groups: unit tests and end-to-end tests. I decided to group the tests with the files I am testing, which made more sense to me.

## <span style="font-size:larger;">Unit Tests</span>

All the configuration for these tests is in the _jest.config.js_ file, so there's no need to configure anything. To run the tests, use the command `npm run test` (make sure you are inside the "backend" folder in the terminal). You should see something like this:

![image](https://github.com/Xugnon/tatto_studio/assets/85856491/cc233882-baee-4d3f-95b5-79c65713ce3b)

## <span style="font-size:larger;">End-to-End Tests (E2E)</span>

The configuration for these tests is in the _jest-e2e.config.js_ file, which copies everything from the _jest.config.js_ file and overrides some settings. Jest then runs the _prisma-test-environment.js_ file within the Prisma folder and looks for files with the _\*\*.e2e-spec.js_ suffix to execute them. For each file, a random schema is created within the database, tests are executed, and then the schema is deleted. This ensures a clean database for each test. To run the tests, use the command `npm run test:e2e` (again, make sure you are inside the "backend" folder in the terminal). You should see something like this:
